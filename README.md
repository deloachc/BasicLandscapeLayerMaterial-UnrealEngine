# BasicLandscapeLayerMaterial-UnrealEngine
A material for quickly setting up landscape layers to paint with in landscape mode.


# INSTRUCTIONS
Copy the BasicLandscapeLayers folder into your project's Content folder. Make sure you don't copy it with any of the parent folders generated by the Github zip file.

Use the MI_BasicLandscapeLayers material instance with your landscape. Replace the default textures for each layer in the material instance with the textures you want to use for your layers.

You will also need to set the LayerInfo for each layer. You can do this in the Paint tab of Landscape Mode. At the bottom of the Paint tab, you'll see the layers and you can set each one using the dropdown menu to select the LayerInfo (LayerInfo objects are included).

If you need more than 4 layers, instructions for adding new layers are included in the M_BasicLandscapeLayers material.
